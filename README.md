I like the theme.  Rick & Morty theme is funny with Jerry.  Makes sense with the theme.  I like the color for its calm coloration and matching the background.  The font is a great touch as well.  Your JavaScript is working properly and you used a async  with fetch properly.  I see no glaring issues.  If you choose to make this reactive to the screen sizing, I can see this as a small site or app that can be monotized with adds which can then generate a lil money.
